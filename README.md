# Recipe-selector

I built this web app that acts as a recommendation engine.  The stack includes Python, Flask, and MySQL. It recommends a list of food dishes based on predefined search criteria.  The search algorithm is a bit more dynamic where if the selection is confirmed it will not be repeated for a certain period of time. 

URL for the webapp is http://varun331.pythonanywhere.com/
